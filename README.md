# 🧩 Custom Notion Widgets

This repository contains a collection of custom Notion widgets that I created after searching extensively for existing options but not finding any that fully suited my needs. I decided to build my own—and I'm sharing them here in case you find them useful too.

## 📦 What's Included

### 1. 📅 Day, Month, and Year Progress Tracker

A clean, minimalist widget that visually displays your progress through the **current day**, **month**, and **year**. It’s a great way to stay aware of time and stay focused on your goals.

### 2. ⏳ Deadline Tracker

A simple and effective countdown widget to help you track important deadlines. Perfect for project milestones, exam dates, personal goals, or any target date you don’t want to lose sight of.

More widgets may be added over time.  
Feel free to fork the repo, customize the widgets to your liking, or open an issue with suggestions!
